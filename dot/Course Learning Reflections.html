    <h1>What are the Kinds of Problems We See in Nature?</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Iteration Problems</h2>

    <h3>Examples in Nature</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Iteration means repeating steps in a loop until the job is done.</li>
      <li>Think of the sun rising and setting every day—it’s a repeating cycle.</li>
      <li>Counting the rings on a tree to know its age—each ring is added one at a time over the years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples in Coding</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p>🔹 Going through a list to find the largest number.</p>
      <p>🔹 Adding all the numbers in a group (like calculating your total grocery bill).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Recursion Problems</h2>

    <h3>Examples in Nature</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recursion is when a problem solves itself in smaller steps until it’s complete.</li>
      <li>Imagine a tree: A branch splits into smaller branches, which split into even smaller branches.</li>
      <li>Think of how you fold a piece of paper in half repeatedly—it’s the same process over and over.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples in Coding</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p>🔹 Calculating factorials (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).</p>
      <p>🔹 Finding your way through a family tree or exploring nested folders on your computer.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Backtracking Problems</h2>

    <h3>Examples in Nature</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Backtracking is like trial and error: you try a path, and if it doesn’t work, you go back and try another one.</li>
      <li>Picture an ant trying to find food—it explores one path, and if it’s blocked, it turns around and tries a different way.</li>
      <li>Solving a maze: If one route doesn’t work, you go back and try a new direction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples in Coding</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p>🔹 Solving puzzles like Sudoku.</p>
      <p>🔹 Finding all possible combinations, like arranging letters to form words.</p>
      <p>🔹 Figuring out the shortest route on a map.</p>

      <section id=2>
    <h1>Space and Time Efficiency</h1>

    <h2>Time Efficiency</h2>
    <p>Time Efficiency is about how fast an algorithm runs. Imagine you’re baking a cake—time efficiency is how quickly you can finish baking.</p>

    <h2>Space Efficiency</h2>
    <p>Space Efficiency is about how much memory or storage an algorithm uses while running. It’s like how many bowls or tools you need to bake that cake. The fewer, the better.</p>

    <h2>Why Are They Important?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Save Time: Faster algorithms mean less waiting.</li>
      <li>Save Memory: Efficient algorithms don’t use too much computer memory, so your device won’t slow down or crash.</li>
      <li>Handle Bigger Problems: Efficient algorithms can process large amounts of data without issues.</li>
      <li>Better User Experience: Nobody likes apps or websites that are slow and laggy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Problems</h2>
    <h3>Easy Problems (P)</h3>
    <p>Problems that computers can solve quickly. For example, sorting a list of names or finding the shortest path on a map.</p>

    <h3>Tricky Problems (NP)</h3>
    <p>Harder to solve but easy to check, like solving a jigsaw puzzle.</p>

    <h3>Super Tricky Problems (NP-Complete)</h3>
    <p>The hardest puzzles. If we figure out a fast way to solve one of them, we can solve many other tricky problems just as fast.</p>

    <h3>Impossible Problems (NP-Hard)</h3>
    <p>Problems so tough that no one knows how to solve them efficiently—or even check the answer easily in some cases.</p>

    <h2>Orders of Growth</h2>
    <h3>O(1) – Constant Time</h3>
    <p>No matter the size, it always takes the same time. Example: Picking the first book from a pile.</p>

    <h3>O(log n) – Logarithmic Time</h3>
    <p>Grows slowly as input increases. Example: Finding a name in a phone book (binary search).</p>

    <h3>O(n) – Linear Time</h3>
    <p>Time grows directly with input size. Example: Reading all the books in a stack one by one.</p>

    <h3>O(n log n) – Linearithmic Time</h3>
    <p>Grows a bit faster, often seen in efficient sorting methods. Example: Sorting your books by size.</p>

    <h3>O(n²) – Quadratic Time</h3>
    <p>Time grows really fast, usually when there are nested loops. Example: Comparing every book with every other book.</p>

    <h3>O(2ⁿ) – Exponential Time</h3>
    <p>Time doubles with each new piece of data. Example: Trying every possible combination of books to find the best arrangement.</p>

    <h3>O(n!) – Factorial Time</h3>
    <p>Time explodes! Example: Arranging 10 books in every possible order (10! = 3,628,800 ways).</p>

    <h1>Tree Data Structures</h1>

    <h2>1. General Tree</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A tree where each node can have many children.</p>
    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Organizing anything hierarchical, like a family tree or folder structure.</p>
    <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Slow for searching because it’s unstructured.</p>

    <h2>2. Binary Search Tree (BST)</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A tree where left = smaller values, and right = larger values.</p>
    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Fast searching, adding, and deleting (if the tree is balanced).</p>
    <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Can get unbalanced and slow if data is added in the wrong order.</p>

    <h2>3. AVL Tree</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A balanced version of a BST (always keeps its height small).</p>
    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Applications with frequent updates (e.g., databases).</p>
    <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> A bit slower due to constant balancing (rotations).</p>

    <h2>4. 2-3 Tree</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A tree where nodes can hold 1 or 2 values and always stays balanced.</p>
    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> File systems or databases that need consistent performance.</p>
    <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> More complex than simpler BSTs.</p>

    <h2>5. Red-Black Tree</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A self-balancing BST that uses “red” and “black” node colors to stay balanced.</p>
    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Systems with lots of insert/delete operations (e.g., maps, dictionaries).</p>
    <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Slightly slower search than AVL, but faster updates.</p>

    <h2>6. Heap</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A special tree where the smallest (or largest) value is always at the top.</p>
    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Priority-based tasks (like scheduling or finding the best option quickly).</p>
    <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Only good for finding the top value; not ideal for general searching.</p>

    <h2>7. Trie (Prefix Tree)</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A tree for strings, where each level represents a character.</p>
    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Autocomplete, dictionaries, or finding words by prefix.</p>
    <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Uses more memory because of pointers.</p>

    <h2>When to Use What:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hierarchy or general structure:</strong> General Tree.</li>
      <li><strong>Fast search for sorted data:</strong> BST (if data isn’t messy).</li>
      <li><strong>Always balanced:</strong> AVL or Red-Black Tree.</li>
      <li><strong>Priority-based tasks:</strong> Heap.</li>
      <li><strong>Working with strings:</strong> Trie.</li>

    <h1>Array Query Algorithms: Need, Types, and Applications</h1>

    <h2>What Are Array Query Algorithms?</h2>
    <p>Array query algorithms help us efficiently retrieve or update data from an array, enabling faster responses to repeated operations.</p>
    
    <h3>Common Array Queries:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Find the sum of numbers in a specific part of the list.</li>
      <li>Find the largest or smallest number in a section of the list.</li>
      <li>Update a value at a specific index in the list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Do We Need These Algorithms?</h2>
    <p><strong>Speed:</strong> Without these algorithms, we'd have to check every number in the list, which can be slow—especially for large datasets.</p>
    <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> These algorithms make sure that you can get answers in a fraction of the time, even with huge datasets.</p>
    <p>They’re crucial for real-time applications, such as live sports score tracking or financial market analysis.</p>

    <h2>Types of Array Query Algorithms</h2>

    <h3>1. Prefix Sum (Cumulative Sum)</h3>
    <p><strong>What it does:</strong> It calculates the sum of all elements from the start of the list to each point, allowing fast sum queries.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Want the sum of numbers from position 3 to position 5? With prefix sums, you can get it instantly!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Segment Tree</h3>
    <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Helps manage data in sections and allows fast queries like sum, max, or min for specific segments of the list.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> In gaming, you may need to find the highest score between level 10 and level 20. A segment tree answers this quickly.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)</h3>
    <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Similar to segment trees but optimized for efficient updates and queries on dynamic datasets.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Updating a leaderboard's score and instantly getting the total score.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>4. Sparse Table</h3>
    <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Efficiently answers range queries like finding the minimum or maximum, especially when the list doesn’t change often.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Finding the lowest temperature in a city for the past month when the data doesn't change often.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Where Are These Algorithms Used?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> Quickly calculate stock prices or sales transactions over a specific period.</li>
      <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Track player scores, health points, or resources in different levels.</li>
      <li><strong>Search Engines:</strong> Optimize data retrieval from large datasets or databases.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-Time Systems:</strong> Critical for applications requiring instant feedback, such as live sports scores.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Do These Algorithms Work?</h2>
    <p><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> Algorithms like prefix sum require preprocessing, but once set up, they provide quick answers.</p>
    <p><strong>Efficient Searching:</strong> Segment trees and BIT allow querying in just a few steps, even for large lists.</p>
    <p><strong>Updating Data:</strong> For frequently updated lists, these algorithms ensure that queries remain efficient even after updates.</p>

    <div class="important">
      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Array query algorithms make large data handling fast and efficient.</li>
        <li>They play a significant role in applications requiring quick data access or updates, like gaming or financial analysis.</li>

    <h1>Difference Between Tree and Graph</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Structure</h2>
    <p><strong>Trees:</strong> A tree is like a <span class="tree">family tree</span>. There’s one main node at the top (the root), and every other node is connected in a clear parent-child relationship. Trees do not have loops or shortcuts.</p>
    <p><strong>Graphs:</strong> A graph is more like a <span class="graph">road map</span>. It consists of nodes connected by edges, and you can have multiple ways to travel between nodes. Graphs may contain loops and cycles.</p>

    <h2>2. Connection</h2>
    <p><strong>Trees:</strong> Trees are always connected, meaning you can always reach every node from the root without any loops.</p>
    <p><strong>Graphs:</strong> Graphs are more general and may contain disconnected components or loops.</p>

    <h2>How Do We Move Through Them?</h2>

    <div class="traversal">
      <h3>Tree Traversals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-order:</strong> Visit the root, then left, then right.</li>
        <li><strong>In-order:</strong> Visit the left, then root, then right (great for sorting).</li>
        <li><strong>Post-order:</strong> Visit left, right, then root (used for tree deletions).</li>
        <li><strong>Level-order:</strong> Visit nodes layer by layer from top to bottom.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="traversal">
      <h3>Graph Traversals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Depth-First Search (DFS):</strong> Explore as far as possible down one path before backtracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</strong> Explore all nearby nodes before moving further.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Where Are Trees and Graphs Used?</h2>

    <h3>Applications of Trees</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Organizing Information:</strong> File systems (folders and subfolders), family trees.</li>
      <li><strong>Searching Fast:</strong> Binary Search Trees (BST) allow fast searches (e.g., dictionary lookups).</li>
      <li><strong>Game Strategies:</strong> AI for decision-making in games like chess.</li>
      <li><strong>Parsing Data:</strong> Trees are used to evaluate expressions like formulas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Applications of Graphs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Social Networks:</strong> People as nodes and friendships as edges.</li>
      <li><strong>Maps:</strong> Cities as nodes and roads as edges (used in GPS).</li>
      <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Websites as nodes and hyperlinks as edges for search engines.</li>
      <li><strong>Routing Networks:</strong> Used in computer networks and delivery systems.</li>

    <!-- Spanning Trees Section -->
    <div class="spanning-trees">
      <h2>Spanning Trees</h2>
      <p><strong>What is it?</strong> A spanning tree is a way to connect all points (nodes) in a graph using the least number of connections (edges), avoiding loops.</p>

      <h3>Real-World Uses:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimizing the cost of building roads, cables, or pipelines between cities.</li>
        <li>Designing electricity grids to ensure all homes are connected efficiently.</li>
        <li>Building railway networks with the least material or cost.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Algorithms:</h3>
      <p><strong>1. Prim's Algorithm:</strong> Starts with a single point and keeps adding the smallest connection to grow the network.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Kruskal's Algorithm:</strong> Picks the smallest connections first, ensuring everything connects without loops.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>Imagine you need to connect four cities with the least cost. A spanning tree will ensure you use the minimum number of roads, saving resources.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="benefits">
        <h3>Key Benefits:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduces construction costs for large networks like electricity grids or internet cables.</li>
          <li>Ensures efficient resource usage in real-world projects.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Shortest Paths Section -->
    <div class="shortest-paths">
      <h2>Shortest Paths</h2>
      <p><strong>What is it?</strong> The shortest path in a graph is the minimum distance or cost required to travel between two points.</p>

      <h3>Real-World Uses:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> GPS apps like Google Maps calculate the fastest or shortest route to your destination.</li>
